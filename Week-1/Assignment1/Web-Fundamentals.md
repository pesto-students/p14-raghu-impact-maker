1. Protocol stack is a set of communication protocol which can be used to transmit data over a network
   It is a hierarchy of software layers with application layer on the top to the data link layer on the bottom
   and the other layers including transport layer and network layer.The architecture of protocol stack is as follows

Application->Transport->Network->Link->Physical

Application of protocol stack in web development are as follows:

1) It is used to establish secure communication between a web application and a client
2) It encrypts data transmitted between the web server and client and provides authentication and integrity checks

So in conclusion protocol stack ensures web application have a set of communication protocols to establish secure connections and protect data
which is transmitted over a network.

2. Different type of servers are as follows

1) Apache Web Server: It open source web server software which is known for high performance, stability and flexibility and
   supports a rnage of operating system including Linux ,windows and macOs
2) IIS Web server:  It is made by microsoft and is designed to run on windows operating system. It is know for security features,
   scalability, support for Microsoft technologies
3) Nginx Web server: It is an open source web server known for speed, scalability and ease of use
4) Lightttpd server: It is a lightweight open source web server software which a low resource(cpu and memory) consumption and
   is designed for high performance.It is known for it security option, stability and high speed along with being lightweight.

3. Web hosting is a service that allows a website to be published online and it allocated an ip address across a unique domain
   Different types of hosting are: Shared hosting, cloud hosting , managed hosting , vps hosting, dedicated hosting

4. Scaling means the number of request/ traffic that can be handled/supported by a web application. The point
   at which the application cannot handle requests is called limit of scalability which is because the
   application runs out of resources. Both horizontal as well as vertical scaling adds computing resources to
   the infrastructure in a different way to improve performance. Vertical scaling involves adding more power(CPU,RAM, storage) to an existing machine/resource.
   Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or nodes to the system. Vertical scaling handles reosurce intensive work which
   requires more computing power whereas horizontal scaling is used to handle increasing amount of traffic.

5. Search engines- Process of improving website's visiblity on the search engines. It improves
   quality and quantity of traffic to a website or a webpage from search engines

The web developers can optimise their website for better search engine rankings as follows
1. Getting the prescribed domains which will increase website visibility.
2. Working on the content and updating it regularly encourages search engines to visit the website
3. Making it user-friendly and improving the social media presence
4. Using keywords, meta tags and backlinks in websites
5. Improving the site loading time to help seo algorithms to rate website higher
