        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>The climate of Delhi is an overlap between monsoon-influenced humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification Cwa) and semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSh), with high variation between summer and winter temperatures and precipitation. Delhi's version of a humid subtropical climate is markedly different from many other humid subtropical cities such as São Paulo, Houston, and Brisbane in that the city features dust storms (something more commonly seen in a desert climate) and wildfire haze (something seen in a Mediterranean climate) due to its semi-arid climate.[1]</p>
